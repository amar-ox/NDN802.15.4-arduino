# NDN802.15.4-arduino


## What is it?
*NDN-802.15.4* is an Arduino library for using [Named Data Networking](http://named-data.net/) over IEEE802.15.4.

*Work in progress...*

## It Implements
* The three NDN data structures (FIB, PIT, CS)
* R-LF: A reinforcement-based lightweight wireless forwarding strategy
* Very experimental packet representation and compression

## Application Examples
* Arduino sketch to run [ndn-cpp example](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cpp/blob/master/examples/arduino/analog-reading/INSTALL.md) over IEEE 802.15.4.
* Arduino sketch for the experimental forwarding (w/o ndn-cpp)
